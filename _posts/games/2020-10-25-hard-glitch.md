### The Game

A rogue-like adventure cyber adventure set inside your computer.  Help "Glitch" survive and escape the confines of the computer world.  Solve puzzles and come up with a strategy to make it out alive.

### My Contribution

Continued to build out my experience with Javascript games.  First time building/working with a particle system in JS.  First time building out a procedural wall and tile system.

Particle systems (glitch, trace, scan, portal, spawn, missile, color, spark, repair, wait, hex spin,
lightning jump, fade, explosion swirl, blip edge pathing), procedural tile selection and wall generation, FX randomization,
wall tiles art, decrypt/triangle animations, mock ups (tile bg, walls, void, experimentation with negative space/holes,
perspective, color tests), color adjustments, moving wall v2, level design concepts art, floor art, NPC wait animation, warm and
cool level themes, lots of asset and code cleanup, additional tile type rules, seam fix, take/drop animations, move animations,
highlights art v2, laser walls, tile overlay, title screen background
