### The Game

A role-playing action adventure game taking place in and around the medieval village of Falldale.  Rid the village of the goblin threat.  Uncover the truth behind the missing caravan.  Help the Princess bring peace to the countryside once and for all.

### My Contribution

My first real taste for both working on a Javascript game and working on pixel art.

Art (tables, bar stools, wooden walls, flagstones, bar joints, top wall updates, window, pine tree, cliffs, caves, bonfire animation, castle walls), level design (castle, east woods), Tiled integration, map data conversion, assorted bug fixes, collision system updates, new quest code features, AI zone support, orc boss AI improvements, hammer weapon, wizard area colliders, transitions, enemy placement & tuning
