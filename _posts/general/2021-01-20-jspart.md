### About

This article will describe how you can implement a particle system in pure/vanilla javascript for use in web/html games or other web-based/browser projects.

### Meet Pete
<canvas id="cvs1" style="background-color: #373F51;"></canvas>
<button id="button1" style="padding: 2px 8px;">Poke</button>

So **Pete the Particle** is a happy little particle running in the canvas shown above.  Feel free to poke him if he isn't showing up very well.  But you may be wondering...
What exactly is a particle and why would I want to implement my own?  First, in my perspective at least, a particle is simply a procedurally-generated visual effect that can be
added to a game (or any other visual project).  Think of a shower of sparks when you shoot an enemy, a trail of dust that kicks up when your character runs, even footsteps that your character may leave in sand or snow.  These can all be implemented through particles.  And while there are other ways to implement visual effects, I'll present you some advantages to using a particle system, which allows you to fire and forget visual effects so that your game logic doesn't need to keep track of animation or effect state.

<script> 
class Mgr1 {
    constructor() {
        this.canvas = document.getElementById("cvs1");
        this.width = window.innerWidth * .2;
        this.height = window.innerHeight*.2;
        this.canvas.width = this.width;
        this.canvas.height = this.height;
        this.ctx = this.canvas.getContext("2d");
        this.makePete();
        // wire poke button
        let b1 = document.getElementById("button1");
        b1.onclick = this.makePete.bind(this);
    }
    makePete() {
        let v = 200;
        let angle = Math.random() * Math.PI*2;
        this.pete = new PeteParticle({
            x: Math.random() * this.width,
            y: Math.random() * this.height,
            dx: v*Math.cos(angle),
            dy: v*Math.sin(angle),
            color: new Color(169,188,208,1),
            maxx: this.width,
            maxy: this.height,
        });
    }
    update(ctx) {
        this.pete.update(ctx);
    }
    render() {
        this.ctx.clearRect(0,0,this.width,this.height);
        this.pete.render(this.ctx);
    }
}
mgrs.push(new Mgr1());
</script>

### Game Hooks

Let's take a closer look at Pete and how Pete is integrated into the game loop.  To understand how the particle logic works, we need to understand how it will be hooked into your game.  The game model I'm using here assumes that all logic is tied to [Animation Frames](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/window/requestAnimationFrame).  In each frame, you are making updates to your game model and then rendering out the results to display in your browser.  The particle logic will follow this same model.

I'll assume that your game loop looks something like this:

{% highlight javascript %}
var lastUpdate = performance.now();
const maxDeltaTime = 100;
const updateCtx = { deltaTime: 0 };
const canvas = document.getElementById("canvas");
const renderCtx = canvas.getContext("2d");
function loop(hts) {
    updateCtx.deltaTime = Math.min(maxDeltaTime, hts - lastUpdate);
    lastUpdate = hts;
    update(updateCtx);
    render(renderCtx);
    loopID = window.requestAnimationFrame(loop);
}
{% endhighlight %}

Where `update(updateCtx)` and `render(renderCtx)` are your entry points to your game logic.  We'll use these same entry points for operations on particles.  While you could get away with a single function call, there's reasons breaking them out makes sense.  Specifically there may be cases where you want to update the state of particles (e.g.: position and such), but don't want to render it (e.g.: offscreen or not visible).  Also note that I'm passing in a few variables which will be important to particle operations.  `updateCtx` is an object that contains a `deltaTime` attribute, and `renderCtx` is the canvas context onto which stuff will be rendered.  We'll see how these are used when we dive deeper into what makes **Pete** tick.  Let's assume that your main `update` and `render` methods have been updated to call the particle's entry points, as shown here:

{% highlight javascript %}
const pete = new PeteParticle();
update(updateCtx) {
    ...
    pete.update(updateCtx);
    ...
}
render(renderCtx) {
    ...
    pete.render(renderCtx);
    ...
}
{% endhighlight %}

### Particle Logic

To implement **Pete**, we are going to introduce a class to store some data and define the game hooks to allow updates and rendering of the particle.  What data is needed to model the behaviour we are seeing?  Well, there's a position on the screen to start with (let's call that `x`,`y` coordinates), and the shape of the particle, which is a filled circle which can simply be represented by a radius (`size`) as well as a color associated with the particle (`color`).  Those are all static properties, but what about the behaviour?  Well, the particle is moving.  There's lots of ways we could represent that, but the easiest is to just consider the change of position based on x and y axis over time.  Let's call the change in x, delta X and the change in y, delta Y (`dx` and `dy` for short).  Finally, when the particle hits the edge of the canvas it changes direction.  We need some logic to keep track of the bounds of the canvas.  This can be represented by a minimum and maximum x value (`minx`, `maxx`) and same for a y value (`miny`, `maxy`).  Putting that into a class structure and initializing looks like:

{% highlight javascript %}
class PeteParticle {
    constructor(spec={}) {
        // current position
        this.x = spec.x || 0;
        this.y = spec.y || 0;
        // deltas for x,y - represents velocity in pixels per second
        this.dx = (spec.dx || 50) * .001;
        this.dy = (spec.dy || 50) * .001;
        // size of particle
        this.size = spec.size || 5;
        // color of particle
        this.color = spec.color || "red";
        // bounds
        this.minx = spec.minx || 0;
        this.miny = spec.miny || 0;
        this.maxx = spec.maxx || 400;
        this.maxy = spec.maxy || 400;
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

Two notes here:
1. I like to use `spec` objects in constructors.  It allows you to easily change the calling parameters for object creation (which we will do later) as well as allows you a way to easily specify defaults for object creation, which I've done here (*`spec.x || 0` becomes `undefined || 0` which becomes `0` when `spec.x` is `undefined`*).  So you can make a **PeteParticle** just by calling `new PeteParticle()` and you will get something that works.
2. You'll note a `.001` multipled to the `dx` and `dy` values.  If you look back at the game loop, the `deltaTime` attribute being passed to the update function is computed in milliseconds.  I like to think of velocity in terms of pixels per second, so to get to pixels per millisecond, multiply by `.001`.

Now that we have data, let's take a closer look at the `update` and `render` methods that are needed to get **Pete** moving and rendering.  If you remember, `update` is being passed a context that includes a `deltaTime` attribute which represents the amount of time in milliseconds since the last `update` was called.  This is the elapsed time since we've last made any changes to **Pete**.  In the data for **Pete**, we expressed movement by keeping track of a delta x and y which represented the number of pixels of movement per unit time (millisecond in our case, remembering we converted `dx` and `dy` in seconds by multiplying by `.001` converting to milliseconds).  So to get how far **Pete** should have traveled since the last update, all we need to do is multiply the `dx` and `dy` values by `deltaTime` and then store the results.  Take a look:

{% highlight javascript %}
update(updateCtx) {
    let dt = updateCtx.deltaTime;
    // update position
    this.x += Math.round((this.dx * dt));
    this.y += Math.round((this.dy * dt));
}
{% endhighlight %}

Pretty simple right?  *Note: I'm rounding the change in position I'm adding to `x` and `y` as a best practice to keep `x` and `y` as integers.  Floats work too, but are a bit more computationally heavy when rendering.*  This is enough to get **Pete** moving, but **Pete** would quickly become lost as he wanders off the screen we've provided.  To keep **Pete** safe (and always visible) we're going to add a fence that tells **Pete** how far he can go in any direction.  If he goes to far in any direction, we'll tell him to turn around and go in the opposite direction at the same speed.  From our data model for **Pete** the fence was represented by the `minx, miny, maxx, maxy` variables.  Let's take a look at how to implement the fence:

{% highlight javascript %}
update(updateCtx) {
    let dt = updateCtx.deltaTime;
    // update position
    this.x += Math.round((this.dx * dt));
    this.y += Math.round((this.dy * dt));
    // update direction
    if (this.x <= this.minx) this.dx = Math.abs(this.dx);
    if (this.y <= this.miny) this.dy = Math.abs(this.dy);
    if (this.x >= this.maxx) this.dx = -(Math.abs(this.dx));
    if (this.y >= this.maxy) this.dy = -(Math.abs(this.dy));
}
{% endhighlight %}

The logic for the fence is pretty straightforward.  If **Pete's** position ever drops below a minimum or above a maximum, we change the corresponding position delta to be negative or positive to turn **Pete** around.  *Implementation Note: using `Math.abs` is required here vs. just flipping the sign of the delta (e.g.: `this.dx = -this.dx`).  Remember that the delta time passed in is variable as it is the actual milliseconds since last call.  For example, say your `dx` is -5 and current `x` position is 5 and you are passed a `deltaTime` of 10.  Your new position would be calculated as `this.x += -5*10` or `this.x = 5 - 50` or `this.x = -45`.  Assuming our `minx` is 0, -45 is well under this, so we would swap the sign of `dx` which would now be 5.  Now say the next frame's `deltaTime` is 5.  Using the same computation, `this.x += 5*5` or `this.x = -45 + 25` or `this.x = -20`.  Uh oh... this is still below our minumum `minx`, so if we were just swapping the sign, we would send the particle back in the wrong direction.  I actually had this bug when I first implemented ;p.*

Final step is to figure how to actually draw **Pete**.  Using Javascript primitives, this is actually pretty easy.  **Pete** is just a filled circle with a specific color, so we'll use the [Arc](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/arc) primitive:

{% highlight javascript %}
render(renderCtx) {
    renderCtx.beginPath();
    renderCtx.arc(this.x, this.y, this.size, 0, Math.PI*2);
    renderCtx.fillStyle = this.color;
    renderCtx.fill();
}
{% endhighlight %}

Let's break this down.  First `renderCtx.beginPath()` (reference: [BeginPath](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/beginPath)) is used to start a new rendering path in Javascript.  Rendering paths in Javascript allow you to build out a shape using multiple primitives (like lines, arcs, rectangles, etc) before doing a single render/draw call for the entire path you've laid out.  Here, we're only using a single primitive, so it doesn't buy us much, but is still needed to setup our render state.  `renderCtx.arc(this.x, this.y, this.size, 0, Math.PI*2)` is where we are telling Javascript to draw our filled circle.  We pass in **Pete's** position using `this.x, this.y`, `this.size` is the radius of the circle (in pixels) which we set in our constructor, and the `0, MathPI*2` is used to identify the start and end angles (in radians) of the arc to draw (0 to 2*PI is a full circle).  `renderCtx.fillstyle = this.color` is used to set the color of the circle (reference: [FillStyle](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/fillStyle)), which can be named colors like `red` or `black`, RGB hex values like `#808080` for a gray, or a RGB color string like `rgb(127,127,127)` (reference: [CSS Color Value](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value)).  And finally, the `renderCtx.fill()` call renders the path, our circle, to the canvas (reference: [Fill](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/fill)).

### Putting It Together

The last piece of the puzzle is the initialization code for **Pete**.  You'll note that in the first introduction to **Pete** and the canvas below, **Pete** starts at a random location and heads off in a random direction and a fixed speed.  We also need to define what the *fence* parameters should be.  Let's start with the fence, as it's easiest.  We will set **Pete's** boundaries to simply be the boundaries of the canvas we are using.  So `spec = { minx: 0, miny: 0, maxx: canvas.width, maxy: canvas.height }` will do fine.  Starting position also is easy.  We'll pick a random number between 0 and 1 (using `Math.random()`) and multiply by the canvas height and width, as that's the bounds we are using for **Pete**.  For handling movement in a random direction but at constant speed.  I pick a speed, say 200 (measured in pixels per second), then pick a random angle.  To get the x, y deltas, I simply use `Math.sin(angle)` and `Math.cos(angle)`.  Let's put this all in a function:

{% highlight javascript %}
function makePete() {
  let speed = 200;
  let angle = Math.random() * Math.PI * 2;  // angle is in radians, so full circle is PI * 2
  petes.push(
    new PeteParticle({
      x: Math.random() * width,             // random starting location
      y: Math.random() * height,
      dx: speed * Math.cos(angle),          // starting deltas/movement based on angle
      dy: speed * Math.sin(angle),
      color: "#A9BCD0",                     // picking a color
      maxx: width,                          // setting fence max values (min default to 0)
      maxy: height
    })
  );
}
{% endhighlight %}

By putting this in a function, we can now call it multiple times to get multiple particles, all following the same rules. The only thing we haven't accounted for is keeping track of our **Pete** particles.  In the above function there is a `petes.push()` call.  I'm using an array named petes, allocated by using `var petes = [];`.  So that will need to be declared prior to calling our `makePete()` function:

{% highlight javascript %}
var petes = [];
for (let i=0; i<5; i++) {
    makePete();
}
{% endhighlight %}

This handles creating five **Pete** particles (yay, he now has friends!).  But we need to update our `update()` and `render()` functions accordingly:

{% highlight javascript %}
update(updateCtx) {
    for (const pete of petes) {
        pete.update(updateCtx);
    }
}
render(renderCtx) {
    for (const pete of petes) {
        pete.update(renderCtx);
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

<canvas id="cvs2" style="background-color: #373F51;"></canvas>
<button id="button2" style="padding: 2px 8px;">+friend</button>

<script> 
class Mgr2 {
    constructor() {
        this.canvas = document.getElementById("cvs2");
        this.width = window.innerWidth * .5;
        this.height = window.innerHeight*.2;
        this.canvas.width = this.width;
        this.canvas.height = this.height;
        this.ctx = this.canvas.getContext("2d");
        this.petes = [];
        for (let i=0; i<5; i++) {
            this.makePete();
        }
        // wire poke button
        let btn = document.getElementById("button2");
        btn.onclick = this.makePete.bind(this);
    }
    makePete() {
        if (this.petes.length >= 50) return;
        let speed = 200;
        let angle = Math.random() * Math.PI*2;
        this.petes.push(new PeteParticle({
            x: Math.random() * this.width,
            y: Math.random() * this.height,
            dx: speed*Math.cos(angle),
            dy: speed*Math.sin(angle),
            color: new Color(169,188,208,1),
            maxx: this.width,
            maxy: this.height,
        }));
    }
    update(ctx) {
        for (const pete of this.petes) {
            pete.update(ctx);
        }
    }
    render() {
        this.ctx.clearRect(0,0,this.width,this.height);
        for (const pete of this.petes) {
            pete.render(this.ctx);
        }
    }
}
mgrs.push(new Mgr2());
</script>
So now we have **Pete** and a couple of friends.  Use the **+friend** button to add more.

I'll stop here for now, as I ended up being long winded in explaining everything.  And there's still quite a bit of ground to cover.  Hopefully I've outlined some basic concepts: a particle really is some data and rules for updating and rendering.  Logic for initialization lies outside the particle and that we need to be able to hook to the main game loop.  We still need to get to the "fire and forget" point I raised at the beginning of the article.  And I still want to cover more on the creation and expiration of particles and ways to handle that.  And while I'm sure **Pete** is a fine particle, there's a lot more we can do and I'll provide some more exciting examples.  Look for these topics to be covered in more detail in coming posts.

The full code for this example is below, or you can play around with it for yourself using this [CodePen](https://codepen.io/tyallison/pen/zYKQdVV).
